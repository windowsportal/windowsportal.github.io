        <h1>QR Codes</h1>
        <h2 style="color:#2c2c2c">How likely are people willing to give personal information away?</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <h3>MSIS 4233- Expo: Baden Erb</h3><br>
        <h3>The Set Up</h3>

        <h2>Section 1: What is a QR Code</h2>
        <p>A QR Code (Quick Response Code) is a two-dimensional barcode that can store various types of data, such as
            text, URLs, contact information, and more. It was originally created for tracking parts in the automotive
            industry but has since found widespread use in various applications, including marketing, ticketing, and
            product labeling.</p>

        <h2>Section 2: Canary Tokens</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Canary Tokens are a form of digital security measures used to detect unauthorized access or breaches in
                an<img src="./canary.png" alt="Canary Token" class="float-image">
                organization's network or systems. They are essentially pieces of information or files that are
                intentionally placed in sensitive areas of a network to act as early warning indicators.</p>
            <p>These tokens are designed to look like genuine, enticing targets for cyber attackers, and when they are
                accessed, they trigger an alert that indicates a potential security breach. Canary Tokens can take
                various
                forms, including decoy files, fake login credentials, or QR Codes embedded in documents or websites.</p>

            <p>The use of canary tokens in this case are the redirects used to capture the IP address of the scanner,
                the OS of the scanner, and the Machine the user is scanning with.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Section 3: Forms</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>In this section, we'll discuss the Microsoft Form created for Oklahoma State University (OSU) Dining
                Services. This form is designed to collect data to assess how likely individuals are willing to give
                away personal information.</p>
            <p>The form includes various questions and scenarios to gauge respondents' willingness to provide
                information. It can be a valuable tool for understanding user behaviors and attitudes towards data
                sharing in a dining services context.</p>
            <p>I put "Anti-AI" questions at the end that can gauge how much information a user would give away.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>The Form:</h2>
